                    <p>An informative speech provides information about a specific subject to an audience. </p>

                    <p>The aim of an informative speech is to help your audience to understand and to remember the information you are presenting. </p>

                    <p>There are three (3) types of informative speech namely Expository, Descriptive, and Demonstrative Speech. So let's look more closely into these types. </p>

                    <h1 class="section-heading">1. Expository Speech</h1>

                    <p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>The purpose of an explanatory speech is to describe, clarify, explain and/or define an object, idea, concept, social institution or process.</li>
                        <li>The goal of this speech is for the speaker to inform the audience on a particular part of an industry.</li>
                        <li>Explanatory speeches focus on reports of current and historical events, customs, transformations, inventions, policies, outcomes, and options.</li>
                        <li>In short, Expository Speech focuses on the how or why of a subject and its consequences.</li>
                    </ul>
                    </p>

                    <h1 class="section-heading">2. Descriptive Speech</h1>

                    <p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Creates a vivid picture in a persons’ mind regarding an object, person, animal or place.</li>
                        <li>More spontaneous than reading, commanding or answering speech but can be kept easily within a certain subject, thus, restricting the vocabulary.</li>
                    </ul>
                    </p>

                    <h1 class="section-heading">3. Demonstrative Speech</h1>

                    <p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>A demonstration speech explains how to do something or how something works.</li>
                        <li>Shows listeners how some process is accomplished or how to perform it themselves.</li>
                        <li>The focus is on chronological explanation of some process, procedure, application, or course of action.</li>
                        <li>Speakers might focus on processes that have a series of steps with a specific beginning and end or the process may be continuous.</li>
                    </ul>
                    </p>

                            <p>know the interest, the demographics, and the ethnicity of your audience so that you will know what you are going to talk about. This is an important tip to remember so that you will not offend your audience.</p>
                        <li>Organize the information you wish to give to your audience</li>
                            <p>Before starting your speech be sure to have your thoughts organized, it is advisable to have notes written on a tiny piece of paper where you can look into it if you do not know what to say next, but be sure not to read it as if you are reading a book and telling a story.</p>
                        <li>Keep an eye contact with your audience</li>
                            <p>Always look at your audience from time to time so that they would feel that you are talking to them and listen to your speech.</p>
                        <li>Know what you are talking about</li>
                            <p>Know your topic, have a research if needed. Go straight to the point and do not include segues and do not make your audience be confused on what you are talking about.</p>
                        <li>Do not speak fast nor slow.</li>
                            <p>Do not speak fast that your audience can no longer understand your stand and do not speak so slow that your audience are already getting bored. Just be calm and speak as clearly as possible so your audience will understand you and at the same time, they will not get bored.</p>
                        <li>Last but not the least in PRACTICE, PRACTICE, PRACTICE!</li>
                            <p>Before going at the stage and delivering you speech, be sure that you already practiced it with your friends, family, or people you trust and ask them if your practice is good enough. </p>
                    </ol>
                    </p>
